### Test Case Coverage
The coverage report below, generated using IntelliJ IDEA's built-in tool, confirms that all required business logic within the BankAccount class was tested. Key highlights include:

**100% Class and Branch Coverage:** This indicates that the BankAccount class was fully tested, and every if/else condition in the deposit and withdraw methods was executed by the test suite.

**75% Line Coverage:** The line coverage is not 100% because the getBankHolderName() and displayBankAccountInformation() methods were not part of the required testing scope for this lab.

**0% Coverage for BankSystem:** This is expected, as the testing assignment was focused exclusively on the BankAccount class.
